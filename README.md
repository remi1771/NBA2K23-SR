# NBA2K23-SR
Nba 2K23 Super Roster


Using ReedForever's base, I developed some changes and added some players to the list.

The base is for the '83-'84 season

Here's tha Changelog.

v1  - Added Steve Mix to the 82'-83' Lakers Roster, together with his total stats updated, and his 81'-82' Stats PHI added.
v2  - Removed SteveMix 82'-83', created Stevemix 83'-84' and added to the Free Agency Pool. Created Calvin Garrett, Mike Mcgee (and both assigned to lakers) and Rookie Sedale Threatt (and assigned to 76ers)
